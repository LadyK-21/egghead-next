// The prisma models for the entire Postgres database schema are originally

// required tweaking about a dozen errors in the generated models: type
// mismatches (bigint -> int) and foreign key naming mismatches.
//
// Rather than sharing the schema publicly as part of this spike, I'll include
// a private link to it separate from the PR. Just copy and paste that file
// here to try it out.
